# dota-upgraded-10x
 Programmed code based off existing Dota 2 items that can be imported into npc_dota_items.txt and addon_english.txt

# Notes
 Individual items are in the same directory as this README (messy)
 English localization of individual items are in the 'english' folder.
 
 Full compilation of these items are in the 'dota_upgrades' folder, whose contents can be chucked into your addon if you wish.
 -Care must be taken as this method will replace npc_dota_items.txt and addon_english.txt
 -Instead, copy the code inside the files and paste them into the respective files of your addon.
